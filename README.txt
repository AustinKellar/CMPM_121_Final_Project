Controls BEST WITH 2-4 CONTROLLERS:
Controllers:
A - Join / Jump
Hold B - Leave
Left Stick - Move
X - Dash
Start - Ready Up
Back - Close Application (only works in build)

Keyboard:
1 - Spawn Player 1
2 - Spawn Player 2
3 - Spawn Player 3
4 - Spawn Player 4

5 - Despawn Player 1
6 - Despawn Player2
7 - Despawn Player 3
8 - Despawn Player 4

E - Ready Up Player 1 / Start Match
R - Ready Up Player 2 / Start Match

Left Arrow, Right Arrow - Move Player 2
Up Arrow - Dash Player 2
R Shift - Dash Player 2

NOTE:
You cannot move players 3 and 4 without controllers. I hope you get to test with controllers. It is the intended experience. Also, I implemented the Start Match block spawn functionality but as of now, it does not do anything.
